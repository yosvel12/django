                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>At Stormboard, we're committed to offering the best solution for you to collect, evaluate and grow
                    your
                    ideas. We recognize the trust you've placed in us to be the tool to do this.</p>

                <h2>Website Visitors</h2>

                <p>Like most website operators, Stormboard collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
                    that
                    web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
                    referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Stormboard's purpose in collecting
                    non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Stormboard's visitors use its
                    website. From time to time, Stormboard may release non-personally-identifying information in the
                    aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>

                <p>Stormboard also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
                    addresses. Stormboard does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not
                    disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses
                    personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>

                <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

                <p>Registered users to Stormboard's websites choose to interact with Stormboard in ways that require
                    Stormboard to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
                    Stormboard gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, Stormboard collects such
                    information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's
                    interaction with Stormboard. Stormboard does not disclose personally-identifying information other
                    than
                    as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
                    with
                    the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

                <h2>Storm Content</h2>

                <p>One of the primary reasons people use Stormboard is to brainstorm content with others. Examples
                    include
                    adding ideas, organizing ideas, commenting on ideas and voting on your favorite ideas.

                <p>The Storm Content added to a storm is only accessible to the users invited to the storm. Stormboard
                    will
                    not access or view your storm without an explicit invite from you or one of you users seeking
                    technical
                    support. </p>


                <h2>Securing your data</h2>

                <p>Stormboard has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and storm
                    content to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honored. We take strong precautions to
                    protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or
                    destruction. </p>

                <h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

                <p>Stormboard may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance,
                    Stormboard may reveal the average number of storms users create, or say how many people the average
                    person invites. However, Stormboard does not disclose personally-identifying information other than
                    as
                    described below.</p>

                <h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information and Storm Content</h2>

                <p>Stormboard discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information and
                    storm
                    content only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to
                    know
                    that information in order to process it on Stormboard's behalf or to provide services available at
                    Stormboard's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those
                    employees,
                    contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
                    Stormboard's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Stormboard will not
                    rent
                    or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information and storm content
                    to
                    anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above,
                    Stormboard discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information and
                    storm
                    content only when required to do so by law, or when Stormboard believes in good faith that
                    disclosure is
                    reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Stormboard, third parties, or the public
                    at
                    large.</p>

                <p>If you are a registered user of a Stormboard website and have supplied your email address, Stormboard
                    may
                    occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep
                    you
                    up to date with what's going on with Stormboard and our products.</p>

                <h2>Cookies</h2>

                <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the
                    visitor's
                    browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Stormboard uses cookies to help
                    Stormboard identify and track visitors, their usage of Stormboard website, and their website access
                    preferences. Stormboard visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should
                    set
                    their browsers to refuse cookies before using Stormboard's websites, with the drawback that certain
                    features of Stormboard's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

                <h2>Privacy Policy Changes</h2>

                <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Stormboard may change its Privacy Policy from time to
                    time,
                    and in Stormboard's sole discretion. Stormboard encourages visitors to frequently check this page
                    for
                    any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy
                    Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
